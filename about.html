              <h3 class="fw-bold fs-5 mt-5 mb-3">Intellectual Property</h3>
              <p>
                The intellectual property in the materials contained on this
                website is owned by or licensed to Pointrix and is protected by
                applicable copyright and trademark laws. Users are granted
                permission to download one copy of the materials for personal,
                non-commercial transitory use. This constitutes the grant of a
                license, not a transfer of title. The license will automatically
                terminate if you violate any of these restrictions or the Terms
                of Service and may be terminated by Pointrix at any time.
              </p>
              <h3 class="fw-bold fs-5 mt-5 mb-3">User-Generated Content</h3>
              <p>
                You retain your intellectual property ownership rights over
                content you submit to us for publication on our website. We will
                never claim ownership of your content, but we do require a
                license from you to use it. When you use our website or its
                associated services to post, upload, share, or otherwise
                transmit content covered by intellectual property rights, you
                grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable,
                sub-licensable, worldwide license to use, distribute, modify,
                run, copy, publicly display, translate, or otherwise create
                derivative works of your content in a manner consistent with
                your privacy preferences and our Privacy Policy. You can
                terminate the license by deleting your content or account, but
                it may continue in connection with commercial or sponsored
                content until such content is discontinued by us. You grant us
                permission to use your username and other identifying
                information associated with your account in a manner consistent
                with your privacy preferences and our Privacy Policy.
              </p>
              <h3 class="fw-bold fs-5 mt-5 mb-3">Liability</h3>
              <p>
                Our website and the materials on our website are provided on an
                "as is" basis. To the extent permitted by law, Pointrix makes no
                warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and
                negates all other warranties, including implied warranties or
                conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose,
                or non-infringement of intellectual property or other violation
                of rights. In no event shall Pointrix or its suppliers be liable
                for any consequential loss suffered or incurred by you or any
                third party arising from the use or inability to use this
                website or the materials on this website, even if Pointrix or an
                authorized representative has been notified, orally or in
                writing, of the possibility of such damage. Consequential loss
                includes any indirect loss, real or anticipated loss of profit,
                loss of benefit, loss of revenue, loss of business, loss of
                goodwill, loss of opportunity, loss of savings, loss of
                reputation, loss of use, and loss or corruption of data. Because
                some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied
                warranties or limitations of liability for consequential or
                incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.
              </p>
              <h3 class="fw-bold fs-5 mt-5 mb-3">Accuracy of Materials</h3>
              <p>
                The materials appearing on our website are not comprehensive and

                warrant or make any representations concerning the accuracy,
                likely results, or reliability of the use of the materials on
                this website or otherwise relating to such materials or on any
                resources linked to this website.
              </p>
              <h3 class="fw-bold fs-5 mt-5 mb-3">Links</h3>
              <p>
                Pointrix has not reviewed all of the sites linked to its website
                and is not responsible for the contents of any such linked site.
                The inclusion of any link does not imply endorsement, approval,

              <h3 class="fw-bold fs-5 mt-5 mb-3">Right to Terminate</h3>
              <p>
                We may suspend or terminate your right to use our website and
                terminate these Terms of Service immediately upon written notice
                to you for any breach of these Terms of Service.
              </p>
              <h3 class="fw-bold fs-5 mt-5 mb-3">Severance</h3>
              <p>
                Any term of these Terms of Service that is wholly or partially
                void or unenforceable is severed to the extent that it is void
                or unenforceable. The validity of the remainder of these Terms
                of Service is not affected.
              </p>
